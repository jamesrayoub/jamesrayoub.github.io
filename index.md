## What I'm Up To

Currently leading data initiatives at [Dandelion Energy](www.dandelionenergy.com) where I joined as the company's first analyst in 2020.

## Where I've Been

Before Dandelion, I spent about 4 years at various DTC companies (graze, Plated, Rent the Runway) focusing on supply chain/operations problems as an analyst on those teams.
