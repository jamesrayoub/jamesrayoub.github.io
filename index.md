# About Me

Currently leading data platform efforts at Dandelion Energy with a particular focus on leveraging the data warehouse as a source of truth to enable applications outside of the traditional BI use cases; think CRM/ERP automations, Slack bots, etc. I joined Dandelion in Aug 2020 and it was a greenfield opportunity to build data capabilities from scratch; the latest iteration consists of tools and frameworks like Fivetran, BigQuery, dbt, and Hightouch. 

Previously, I spent a number of years as an analyst for e-commerce companies such as Rent the Runway, Plated, and Graze focused on supply chain/operations problems which was my undergraduate focus.
